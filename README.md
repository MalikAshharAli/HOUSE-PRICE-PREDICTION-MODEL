# HOUSE-PRICE-PREDICTION-MODEL

# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project shows how to **predict house prices** using a simple **Linear Regression model**.  
We use basic features like:

- ✅ Total Area (in square feet)
- 🛏️ Number of Bedrooms
- 🛁 Number of Bathrooms

Our goal is to make it **easy for beginners** to understand how machine learning models work with real estate data.

## 📂 Dataset

We used a custom real estate dataset containing housing details like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and prices.

📌 File used: `real_estate_main.csv`  
📝 Contains features like:
- `total_area` – total square footage of the house
- `bedroom` – number of bedrooms
- `bathroom` – number of bathrooms
- `Price` – target value (what we want to predict)

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries

We used Python along with:

| Library        | Use Case                         |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| `pandas`       | To load and handle data          |
| `scikit-learn` | For training the ML model        |
| `numpy`        | For calculations                 |
| `matplotlib`   | (Optional) For visualizations    |

## 🚀 How It Works

We follow these simple steps:

1. **Import** the required libraries
2. **Load** the dataset
3. **Select** the features and the target
4. **Split** the data into training and testing sets
5. **Train** a linear regression model
6. **Predict** prices and evaluate the model using RMSE
7. **Print** the learned formula to predict new prices

## 📊 Model Formula

Once trained, the model gives us a price estimation formula like:

Price = a * total_area + b * bedroom + c * bathroom + d

Where:
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are coefficients (learned by the model)
- `d` is the intercept (constant value)

You can plug in values to estimate house prices!

## ✅ Example Output

```bash
Root Mean Squared Error: 5840213.62

Price = 8123.23 * total_area + 1283952.21 * bedroom + 1482941.53 * bathroom + 1952000.00
